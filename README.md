# About

Loop is a a real time student activity tracker and feedback system.
Nowadays, when only metric to judge a student is using academics, we want to analyze a student on the basis of their co-curricular activities too.

So, for tracking students activities and progress we created a web-platform which can help students as well as teachers in analyzing strengths and weakness of a student.

## Features
Some of the features of our web-app are:

__1.)  Same platform for both students and teachers:__ This feature will be very helpful for both of the users as well as us(the developers). User can sign in according to their role (Students and Teachers) and then access the portal differently. This feature is also helpful to us as we don't have to create two different platforms and maintain the codebases of both of them.

__2.) Leaderboard:__ We created a leaderboard system which shows the list of students who are top performer in any of the categories. The categories on which we will generate the leaderboard are __*Academics, Co-Curricular and Overall.*__ This will help teachers in analyzing their students performance as well as students will also become competitive as they will try to perform better than their peers.

__3.) Daily quizzes:__ For daily monitoring of students academic progress, we will perform and record daily quizzes of the topics taught on that particular day. Also, this will help in making students consistent and disciplined.

__4.) Section for uploading achievements :__ For collecting co-curricular data we will take inputs from the students and event organizers which will be pushed on a social media type interface. This is somewhat similar to LINKEDIN's interface and this will help them in getting recognition among peers, teachers and other authorities.

__5.) Automated Feedback System :__ This whole web app is for making tasks easier for teachers and this feedback system will definitely be helpful for them. 

We are using Machine-Learning for analyzing performance of the whole batch and then give feedback according to their weaknesses. Teachers can also send feedback to students, manually. 

__5.) Online classes and Courses:__ _This is the feature which differentiates us from others._ On this platform teachers can take online classes and then they can publish those lectures as courses which students can access whenever they need. This will be beneficial to both teachers and students.
